## Overview
This is a simple ASP.Net Core web application making use of Entity Framework and Entity Framework Identity. I'm building and updating the application as a personal exercise. As such, it should not be utilized by anyone for the storage of sensitive and required data. Data will not be persisted into perpetuity. 

## Immediate Tasks
1. Add sorting to Accounts, Categories, and Vendors indexes.
2. Add filtering to Accounts, Categories, and Vendors indexes.
3. Add pagination to Accounts, Categories, and Vendors indexes.
4. Correct issue in which entity editing validation failure messages are presented in green success textboxes.
5. Update old HTML BootStrap formating (panels are now cards)

## Roadmap
1. Further refactoring (such as possibly Direct Injecting view models)
